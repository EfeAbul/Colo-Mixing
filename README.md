# üé® Color Mixing Simulation (RGB vs CMY)

This project demonstrates the difference between **light-based (RGB)** and **paint-based (CMY)** color mixing using Python. It provides a simple and visual explanation of how colors blend in different systems: **additive mixing** (used in light) and **subtractive mixing** (used in paints, inks, and dyes).

## üß† Concept Overview

- **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Colors are created by **adding** light.
  - Example: Red + Green = Yellow
- **CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)**: Colors are created by **subtracting** wavelengths from white light.
  - Example: Cyan + Yellow = Green

This notebook simulates both approaches and visualizes the results of different combinations.

## üìÇ File

- `Color_Mixing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full explanation, formulas, and color blending visualizations.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** installed.
2. Required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
3. jupyter notebook Color_Mixing.ipynb
4. Run the cells to see how colors blend in RGB and CMY systems.

# üß™ Features
